### reflection.md

#### What was easy?

Setting up the project with **Vite + React + TypeScript** was quite smooth. Creating and structuring the components (like `NavBar`, `Hero`, `Footer`, etc.) felt intuitive.

---

#### What was hard?

Configuring **Tailwind CSS** was challenging at first. There were a few issues during installation and setup that required troubleshooting. Deploying to **Vercel** took some trial and error, especially with managing build errors. 

---

#### What did AI help you with?

AI helped with:
- Step-by-step project setup instructions (Vite, Tailwind, TypeScript).
- Fixing common build issues like unused imports.
- Tailwind styling and layout tips.
- Debugging deployment errors on Vercel.
- Writing semantic and clean commit messages.
- Explaining SVG icons and React components clearly.

---

#### What suggestions did you reject and why?

Some suggestions for extra animations or component libraries were skipped to keep the project lightweight and minimal. Also, suggestions that added unnecessary complexity or reduced clarity were avoided to stay focused on the core structure.

---

#### What would you add if you had more time?

- **Dark mode toggle** using Tailwind's dark variant.
- **More sections** like Projects, Blog, Contact with working links.
- **Responsive mobile menu** with open/close toggle logic.
- **Animations** using Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions.
- **Form submission** (e.g., a contact form with form validation).
